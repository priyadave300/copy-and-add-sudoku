The function copy_and_add(sudoku: list, row_no: int, column_no: int, number: int) takes a two-dimensional array representing a sudoku grid, two integers referring to the row and column indexes of a single square, and a single digit between 1 and 9, as its arguments. The function should return a copy of the original grid with the new digit added in the correct location. The function should not change the original grid received as a parameter.

The print_sudoku function from the previous repository of print-sudoku-and-add-number is used.
